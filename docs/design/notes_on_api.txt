supabase edge function work like this:

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const { name } = await req.json()
  const data = {
    message: `Hello ${name}!`,
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } })
})



edge function calls api -> if api is up/down -> edge function either passes info or acts appropriately for no AI

Example:

- User sends message to open ticket
- sendMessage from useMessages.ts is called
- corresponding edge function is called
- edge function calls api
- api returns a response
    - if api is down or error (400, 500, etc), system message is sent to user that their ticket is being transferred to a human
    - if api is up (200), edge function returns response from AI api

- considerations:
    - can/should we have a triggered event in supabase to handle this instead of calling stuff from sendMessage? We'll ask an LLM about it maybe
