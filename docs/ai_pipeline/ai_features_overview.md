#### Interaction Flow

1. **User Input**: Customer sends a message via the chat interface.
2. **Intent Recognition**: Chatbot interprets the message to determine intent.
3. **Knowledge Base Query** (if necessary): Retrieves information to formulate a response.
4. **Response Generation**: AI generates and sends the response to the user.
5. **Satisfaction Check**: Bot asks if the issue is resolved.
6. **Escalation** (if needed): Creates a ticket and notifies a human agent.

### 2. Knowledge Base Service
